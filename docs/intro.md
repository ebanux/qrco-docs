The QR Link allows to create and customize your QR code and frame easily. You just need to follow **four simple steps**:

1. Choose the type of QR code
2. Enter the data according to the type of QR.
3. Customize your QR code
4. Download and Share the QR code

Its **main features** are:

- The capability of customizing your QR code and frame in an easy way

- When the QR code is connected with a short URL, it becomes a Dynamic QR code, where you can change the associated content at any time. Since a Dynamic QR code is generated from a short URL, it's less dense compare to a QR code that contains an static URL, so it's easier to read.

- To download the QR code, you can choose between png, svg or pdf. The pdf feature allows to customize the page size, the QR size and the number of QR per page, so you can save materials when  printing.

- Sellers can use payment links to display it anywhere on the internet as a QR code, just by sharing the QR code with customers.

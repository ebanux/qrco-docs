# Claiming a Custom QRLynk

When you're already familiar with QRLynk, you know that during the [New Page creation](../page/create_page) process, you can customize the Short URL for your QRLynk. 

![Claim 01](https://github.com/ebanux/qrco-docs/assets/54523080/2c15f9fd-f566-46b5-8c28-4be9608b32e5)

However, for those who discover QRLynk by visiting its landing page at www.theqr.link there's an opportunity to claim a Custom QRLynk directly from the landing page's "Claim" section. This allows you to incorporate your nickname or your business name as part of the Short URL, customize a Mobile-optimized Page associated with that URL, and register them as your own.

![Claim 02](https://github.com/ebanux/qrco-docs/assets/54523080/1fbec958-e845-47e6-9cd2-0b28c3773845)

You just need to know that the first custom QRLynk is free, but subsequent custom QRLynks require a [subscription plan](../registration/plans). 

Claiming your Custom QRLynk offers the following advantages: 

- Customizing the Short URL associated with your page. 

- Establishing yourself as the owner of this QRLynk. 

- Customizing the content and design of the page you wish to associate with your product.

To Claim your QRLynk, follow the steps outlined below.

1. Choose a code to include in your Short URL, which can be a nickname, business name, or any suitable identifier, and then press the "Claim" button.

   If the code you've chosen has already been claimed, you will be notified that it's not available. Please choose another unique code and try again.

   If the code is available, you will be redirected to a page that explains the steps to claim your QRLynk.

3. When you press the button, you'll be redirected to the app and will need to authenticate. If you don't have a username and password for QRLynk yet, you'll need to register at that moment. You can find detailed instructions on how to register in the [Registration](../registration) section. The registration process is entirely free, and you won't need to provide any banking information.
   
   If you already have an existing QRLynk account, it's beneficial to authenticate with the username and password you've previously created. This way, you can manage all your QRLynks from the same account. However, please keep in mind that if you have previously created a QRLynk without purchasing a plan, you will be required to purchase a plan starting from the second QRLynk.

If, after claiming your first QRLynk, you attempt to create a new one directly in the app or repeat the Claim process to acquire another QRLynk, the app will notify you that you have reached the maximum QRLynks for that account. However, this doesn't have to be a problem. You can purchase a [subscription plan](../registration/plans) and continue enjoying the benefits of our platform.

# Claiming a Pregenerated QRLynk

When you receive a product you've purchased on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/FF316102-847A-40BA-811F-53F2C7434A83) or [Etsy](https://qrlynk.etsy.com/), the associated QR code isn't initially active. To activate it and ensure that the desired Mobile-optimized page is displayed when the QR code on your product is scanned, the first thing you need to do is **Claim your QRLynk**. This process is a one-time requirement and is entirely free.

Claiming your QRLynk provides the following benefits:

- Registering the Short URL associated with the QR code on your product in our platform.
- Establishing yourself as the owner of this QRLynk.
- Customizing the content and design of the page you wish to associate with your product.

To Claim your QRLynk, follow the steps outlined below.

1. Scan the QR code on the product for the first time.

   After scanning the QR code, you will be redirected to a page that explains how to proceed to claim your QRLynk.

3. When you press the button, you'll be redirected to the app and will need to authenticate. If you don't have a username and password for QRLynk yet, you'll need to register at that moment. You can find detailed instructions on how to register in the [Registration](../registration) section. The registration process is entirely free, and you won't need to provide any banking information because products purchased in our stores are one-time payments and don't require a monthly subscription.
   
   If you already have an existing QRLynk account, it's beneficial to authenticate with the username and password you've previously created. This way, you can manage all your QRLynks from the same account.

4. After logging in, you can start customizing the page associated with your product. You can choose to begin your page from a template in our template list.
   
   ![Claim 05](https://github.com/ebanux/qrco-docs/assets/54523080/c59ef257-6089-4d8b-a85d-41318be36486)
   
   Alternatively, you can select the type of page you want to associate with your product and create the page based on specific suggestions tailored to that particular type.
   
   ![Claim 06](https://github.com/ebanux/qrco-docs/assets/54523080/f2553667-d705-410b-acdd-5568519e045b)
   
   Then press the button Next

5. Ensure you specify a name for your QRLynk; it's mandatory to save your changes and identify it in your list of QRLynks. Select a template and edit the information you want to include on your page, as well as its design. For a detailed explanation of how to customize a page, you can visit the [Create a New Page](../page/create_page) section.

6. When you have your page ready, and you're satisfied with what you see in the preview, press the "Save" button.
   
   ![Claim 09](https://github.com/ebanux/qrco-docs/assets/54523080/ab827b6f-2fe6-4d81-8827-ddf5843d59aa)

7. After saving, you will see the QRLynk associated with your product in your list of QRLynks. The "FREE" label indicates that it's not associated with any subscription because it's a QRLynk linked to a store-bought product. Please note that in the list, there may be QRLynks that are not marked as "FREE" because they are not associated with store-bought products; this is possible by purchasing a [subscription plan](../registration/plans). This can be particularly convenient if you want to customize QRLynks beyond those associated with the products you purchased in the store.
   
   At this point, you can directly access the link from the app to verify that it displays the expected result. You can also scan your product to ensure it correctly displays the created page.

8. You can return to your list of QRLynks whenever you like and edit the content or design of your page. For more details on how to manage your page, please check the [Page Management](../page/manage) section.
   
   ![Claim 11](https://github.com/ebanux/qrco-docs/assets/54523080/d3aaf4c8-3896-4da1-9d4b-14f18eb49bf5)

When you purchase products on Amazon or Etsy, each product comes with an associated QR code that can be claimed as a Pregenerated QRLynk. You can claim as many Pregenerated QRLynks as the number of products you've bought. However, if you wish to create additional Custom QRLynks, which aren't associated with store-bought products, please note that a subscription plan is required for each Custom QRLynk beyond the first one. 

If you attempt to claim more Custom QRLynks (not associated with store-bought products), the app will notify you that you've reached the maximum QRLynks for that account. But don't worry, you can easily resolve this by purchasing a [subscription plan](../registration/plans), allowing you to continue enjoying the full benefits of our platform.

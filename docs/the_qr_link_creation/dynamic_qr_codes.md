This section explain some details about the dynamic QR codes.

## Features of Dynamic QR codes

- Dynamic QR codes have a short URL embedded in the code, which can redirect the user to the destination target URL. 

- The target URL can be changed after the QR code has been generated, while the short URL embedded in the code remains the same. So, after editing the short URL, a Dynamic QR Code can lead the user to a different URL destination and consequently to different content or a different function.

- Since the short URL associated to the dynamic QR code never change, the QR code remains invariable, even when you change the target URL. That means you can use the same QR code to lead the user to a different content. So you can save materials in those cases the QR codes are already printed, you just need to edit the QR code and reuse the printed materials. 

- The dynamic QR code is generated from a short URL, so the QR code is less dense than an static QR code and consequently easier to read.

- Some types of QR code lead the user to a micropage with specific information according to the type of QR code. The information in the micropage can be modified anytime you need.

## Types of Dynamic QR codes

A QR code contains information such as an URL or an string of characters. Depending on the structure of that information, the QR code may lead the user to open a webpage in a browser, to send an SMS or a whatsapp message, etc.

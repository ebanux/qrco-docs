You can use the The QR Link to create static QR codes for free, so you don't need to sign in for creating a static QR code. However there are some limitations when you use the platform without getting authenticated:

- You can create only static QR codes. Static QR Codes contain constant data, for example, an embedded URL with a fixed destination. The invariable data like the fixed URL is part of the QR code pattern, which means you canâ€™t edit static QR codes. So, an Static QR Code always leads the user to the same URL destination

- After designing the QR code you are forced to export it as an external file of type png, svg or pdf. Since you are not authenticated, you are not able to save your QR code in the platform to manage it later.

So, we strongly recommend to register for an account and sign in before start designing your QR code. The benefits of using the platform as an authenticated user are:

- You can create both Static and Dynamic QR codes. Dynamic QR codes have a short URL embedded in the code, which can redirect the user to the destination website URL. The destination URL can be changed after the QR code has been generated, while the short URL embedded in the code remains the same. So, after editing the short URL, a Dynamic QR Code can lead the user to a different URL destination and consequently to different content or a different function.

- When you finish the design of the QR code, you are able to save it to manage it later. So, you can export it whenever you want or even edit it. 

- When you edit a Static QR code you are able to modify only its design. Since it's a Static QR code, its content remains invariable. 

- When you edit a Dynamic QR code you can modify both its design and the associated content while the QR code remains invariable. The Dynamic QR code contains a short URL which point to a target URL. The target URL can be changed when you edit the Dynamic QR code so you can change the associated content; however the code remains invariable because the short URL never change.

- Most of the types of Dynamic QR codes allows to implicitly create, together with a Short URL, a microsite, in other words, a mobile-friendly landing page to show the information according to the type you choose. The information shown in the microsite can be easily updated. An there's more, there are some analytics & track associated to the microsite, that way you can get statistics about the access to your microsite, such as how many visits have taken place, which devices have been used to access the Short URL, from which locations, etc. So, we prefer to call this kinds of QR codes as QR Links. A QR Link encapsulates not only the QR code but also a Short Link and a microsite with the statistics related to its use.

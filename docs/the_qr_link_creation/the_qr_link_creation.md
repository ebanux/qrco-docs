# The QR Link Creation

[The QR Link](https://www.theqr.link/) is a feature of [Ebanux Marketplace](https://www.ebanux.com/) that facilitates the design of QR codes which can be used for multiple purposes. It is available at https://app.theqr.link/

## How to create a QR code

Generating a QR code with The QR Link is very easy, you just need to follow three simple steps:

**1- Choose the type of QR Code**

Select from URL, Plain Text, vCard, SMS, Email, Twitter, WiFi and more.

**2- Customize your QR Code** 

Enter all the info needed based on your QR type. Desing your QR code with custom shapes, colors and frames.

**3- Download and Share it** 

Download & Share the QR or short URL for any channel.

### Choose the type of QR Code

At first you need to selelc the type of QR code you want to create, for example a QR code that links a website.

Then you will need to enter some information according to the type of QR you want to create. For example, in the case of QR for linking to a website URL you just need to enter the URL. You can find the explanation about the data to be define for every type of QR code in the section [How to create different types of QR codes](#how-to-create-different-types-of-qr-codes)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54523080/183499151-32785554-3483-46a1-b0b7-e1194364c095.png)

When you generate a QR code, it's better if you use a **short link** instead of a static URL. By using our solution for managing **Short Links** you can take advantage of two improvements: a code less dense and the same code can be used to link different URLs, which are described below.

***A code less dense***

When you need to link a long URL the QR code might become dense. So, it's better if you use a short link instead and, as a result, you can generate a less dense code.

For example let's suppose we create a short link https://qrco.sh/a4Y7bO for the static URL https://docs.cenit.io/docs/basic_integration and after that we generate a QR code for both URLs. The image below shows the difference between the QR codes. As you can see, the QR for the short link is simpler than the QR for the static URL which is longer than the short link.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54523080/183731130-2758cb15-d4e4-42e0-ad3e-10b8ec3ec730.png)

***The same code can be used to link different URLs***

Since an **Ebanux Short Link** can be edited, a dynamic URL can be defined, so the same short link can be initially linked to a static URL and you may change the static URL later. For example let's suppose we create a short link https://qrco.sh/a4Y7bO for the static URL https://docs.cenit.io/docs/basic_integration. Later we can edit the short link and change the URL associated to it from https://docs.cenit.io/docs/basic_integration to https://docs.cenit.io/docs/intro. That means the same short link https://qrco.sh/a4Y7bO now is linked to https://docs.cenit.io/docs/intro. 

If we create the QR for the short link, no matter what URL the short link is associated to, the QR code will lead you to one URL or another depending on the short link definition. The picture below explains this example. At first the QR code leads you to the webpage https://docs.cenit.io/docs/basic_integration, but after editing the URL associated to the short link, the same QR code will lead you to the webpage  https://docs.cenit.io/docs/intro.

After selecting the type of QR code, you need to customize it. The customization is similar regardless the type of QR code and you can learn how to do that in the next section. 

### Customize your QR Codes

For customizing the QR code, press the QR Editor button at the bottom right. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54523080/183499264-aa48f013-5435-4c01-bff6-8c61ee053de9.png)

After pressing the QR Editor button, the QR Designar view is shown. The frames section allows you to decide the type of frame surrounding the code. The picture below shows a code with no frame.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54523080/183743650-8808d31d-b1d9-4415-a1b0-aeeda850636b.png)

The pictures below show two different type of frames.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54523080/183743899-c06d6702-974b-450d-b7bb-e9275d89f8f8.png)

When you select a type of frame, you can also customize the color for both the frame and the text. The text can be also edited, we set "SCAN ME" in the case of the example below.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54523080/183744950-4e8805a7-d9b1-43a9-b9f5-9af6e415c05a.png)

The Code style section allows you to customize the shape and color of the four elements related to the code: the code itself, the corners, the corner dots and the background. The location of this four elements is shown below.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54523080/184240689-f96aab00-987d-4292-9072-f754950424d6.png)

And the picture below shows the values we set in the QR code used as an example.

The picture above shows a background with solid color in white, but you can also set a bakground image by changing the bakground type to image, as shown below.

The logo section allows to select the logo to be set in the center of the code.

The picture below shows a design where a predefined logo has been selected.

However you can select a customized image by pressing the Upload button. In the example below the Cenit IO logo has been selected.

### Download and Share it

After completing the customization you can press the Download button to export the QR code to be shared later.

If you select PNG the code can be download as an image that can be shared by sending  it as an email attachment or in a chat conversation, etc.

After selecting the PNG type, the code is automatically saved as shown below.

You should use the SVG type if you want to embed the code in a webpage.

If you want to print the code for sharing a hard copy between customers or if you need to atach a printed code to a product to be sold, shipped or mailed, you probably prefer to use the option pdf.

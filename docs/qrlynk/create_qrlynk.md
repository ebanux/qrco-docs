# Create a QRLynk

In the [Create a New Page](../page/create_page) section, we explain how to create a page. In this section, we will guide you through the process of creating a QRLynk.

## What is a QRLynk?

A **QRLynk** is a composite entity consisting of three essential components: a QR code, a Short URL, and a Mobile-optimized page. When we refer to a QRLynk, we are talking about this perfectly synchronized triad. The QR code acts as the gateway, the Short URL provides an easy online access point, and the Mobile-optimized page is the personalized experience that users encounter when scanning the QR code or visiting the Short URL. Together, these components offer an efficient and effective way to bridge digital information to the physical world and enhance interaction between users and information.

## Creating a QRLynk

Creating a **QRLynk** is a simple process that gives you control over the creation and customization of both the associated QR code and the Mobile-optimized page it directs to. To begin, follow these five straightforward steps:

1. **Select the type of QRLynk** you'd like to create.
2. **Add your content**, tailored to your QRLynk's purpose.
3. **Customize the appearance and design** of your QRLynk's Mobile-optimized page to make it unique.
4. **Personalize the QR code** associated with your QRLynk.
5. **Generate and Share the QRLynk** with your audience, using the customized QR code.

These steps may vary if the user decides to create a static QR code instead of a QRLynk, which will be explained later.

## Start creating a QRLynk

To begin creating your QRLynk, follow these steps:

1. **Log in** to your QRLynk account. If you don't have an account yet, you can learn how to register [here](../registration/registration).
   
   ![Create QRLynk 01](https://github.com/ebanux/qrco-docs/assets/54523080/98df942a-7a22-4345-ba78-e3dd4230c013)

2. Click the **Create** button.

3. From the available options, select **QR code**. This option allows you to create a QRLynk, giving you the flexibility to customize the Short URL, page content, and even the QR code itself. Additionally, you can create a static QR code if needed.
   
   ![Create QRLynk 02](https://github.com/ebanux/qrco-docs/assets/54523080/12fc5ca7-7b74-4119-ae8a-5e17e664cbb1)
   
   If you simply want to create a page without customizing the QR code, choose the [Page](../page/create_page) option. This allows you to create your page quickly without including QR code design.

4. After selecting "Create QR code," make sure that the "DYNAMIC QR CODES" tab is selected. This tab leads to the creation of a QRLynk.
   
   ![Create QRLynk 03](https://github.com/ebanux/qrco-docs/assets/54523080/013e9e50-edb1-4812-9192-d8c2b9344ff0)

5. Alternatively, you can select the "STATIC QR CODES" tab, which leads to the creation of a static QR code. Static QR codes have fewer features compared to QRLynks but are free to use. They might be attractive for specific use cases where you need to generate a QR code quickly and know that you won't need to modify its content later. In this section, we'll focus on creating a QRLynk. For details on how to create a static QR code, please refer to the [Create a Static QR code](static) section.

### General Questions

#### What is a Mobile-optimized Page?

A Mobile-optimized Page is a webpage specifically designed to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience on mobile devices. These pages are responsive and adapt to different screen sizes, making them easy to navigate and read on smartphones and tablets.

#### What are the benefits of using Mobile-optimized Pages?

In the case of QRLynk, Dynamic QR codes offer the additional benefit of enabling users to create and customize Mobile-optimized Pages effortlessly. The content and design of these pages can be edited as frequently as the owner desires, providing a flexible and dynamic user experience.

You have the flexibility to customize both the page and the associated QR code, making it a powerful tool for engaging users.

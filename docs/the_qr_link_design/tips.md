# Tips & Best Practices

**Customizing the QR code** demands you to take advantage of the different options explained at the section [Customize your QR Codes](the_qr_link_creation/the_qr_link_creation.md#Customize_your_QR_Codes)  and to follow the best practices to create a good design.  The section [QR Code Samples](samples) shows some examples of the QR codes you can create by changing some  parameters in the QR Editor. The main goal here is to create a QR code that achieve the expected result when a user scan it. However, there are some details you need to care about when designing a QR code. So, this section shows some tips and best practices for creating beautiful and functional QR codes.

### Color concerns

**Don't keep your QR code black**. Colorizing helps you to get attention from customers and allows to  get a design according to your organization color identity.

**Avoid a light code over a dark background**. Most of the apps work better with a light background and a dar code.

**Be carefull about the contrast**. You need to design a code to be readable for every app, so you should care about the contrast between the code and the background.

**Use a logo instead of a more detailed image**. You need to capture the customer's attention but you should care about the noises introduced by a background image which can make the code unreadable. So it's better if you use a simple logo in the center of the QR code.

### Shape concerns

**Keep the space around the QR code**. The blank space around the QR code is necessary to guarantee the apps can read the code. So, you should miss it.

**Keep the code square**. Avoid to reshape the code after created. Changing its original proportions my cause to turn it unreadable.

### Information concerns

**Be careful about complex designs**.  It's important to be creative but the code needs to be understood as a QR code by customers and apps.

**Provide information about the action**. You need to guarantee both a call to scan it and also the expected result after scan it.

**Avoid to hide the code inside a bigger design**. If you add the QR code inside a poster, a webpage, etc, try to keep it bigger in order to make it perceivable.

### General concerns

**Always test your code**. The goal is to design a functional QR code, so you should test it by using as much apps as possible, that guarantees it's readable. Also check the code content is the right one.

**Keep the quality of the image**. Be carefull about reducing the image quality when printing or embeding the image in a webpage because it can turn unreadable.

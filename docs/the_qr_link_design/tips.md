# Tips & Best Practices

**Customizing the QR code** demands you to take advantage of the different options explained at the section [Customize your QR Codes](the_qr_link_creation/the_qr_link_creation.md#Customize_your_QR_Codes)  and to follow the best practices to create a good design.  The section [QR Code Samples](samples) shows some examples of the QR codes you can create by changing some  parameters in the QR Editor. The main goal here is to create a QR code that achieve the expected result when a user scan it. However, there are some details you need to care about when designing a QR code. So, this section shows some tips and best practices for creating beautiful and functional QR codes.

### Color concerns

**Don't keep your QR code black**. Colorizing helps you to get attention from customers and allows to  get a design according to your organization color identity.

For example, if you want to create a code to lead your customer to Ebanux facebook page, it's better to use blue, which is the color of facebook.

**Avoid a light code over a dark background**. Most of the apps work better with a light background and a dar code.

**Be carefull about the contrast**. You need to design a code to be readable for every app, so you should care about the contrast between the code and the background.

**Use a logo instead of a more detailed image**. You need to capture the customer's attention but you should care about the noises introduced by a background image which can make the code unreadable. So it's better if you use a simple logo in the center of the QR code.

### Shape concerns

**Keep the space around the QR code**. The blank space around the QR code is necessary to guarantee the apps can read the code. So, you shouldn't miss it.

**Keep the code square**. Avoid to reshape the code after created. Changing its original proportions my cause to turn it unreadable.

### Information concerns

**Provide information about the action**. You need to guarantee a call to scan the code, so a few extra information may help.

**Avoid to hide the code inside a bigger design**. If you add the QR code inside a poster, a webpage, etc, try to keep it bigger in order to make it perceivable.

**Be careful about complex designs**. It's important to be creative but the code needs to be understood as a QR code by customers and scanner apps.

### General concerns

**Always test your code**. The goal is to design a functional QR code, so you should test it by using as much apps as possible, that guarantees it's readable. Also check the code content is the right one. 

The first example shows a readable code, however it doesn't lead the user to the Ebanux facebook page but to the Ebanux Webpage.

**Keep the quality of the image**. Be carefull about reducing the image quality when printing or embeding the image in a webpage because it can turn unreadable.

# QR Code Samples

The section [Customize your QR Codes](the_qr_link_creation/the_qr_link_creation.md#Customize_your_QR_Codes)  explains the options for customizing your QR code. This section shows some QR code samples obtained as a result of changing the different options in the QR Editor.  In all cases the frame was set to none and the background is white, but we tried different values for the other parameters, as explained in every case.

The first example shows a QR code with code rounded, corner squared and corner dot rounded (same as code). The code and corner are black but the corner dot is red.

The example below is similar but the corner is now red like the corner dot.

The next three samples keep the same design but the colors of the code, the corner and the corner dot change in every case.

The example below keep the same shapes for the code, the corner and the corner dot. However, in this case we added a default logo.

This one is similar but another default logo was selected.

The sample below is also similar, although in this case a Super Mario logo was uploaded.

The example below  also contains a customized logo, however the shapes of the code, the corner and the corner dot were changed to dots.

In this case the shape of the code and the corner dot were changed to smooth while the corner shape remains as dot.

The sample below changed the shape of the code and the corner dot to elegant.

The next example was created with code rounded, and the shapes of the corner dot and the corner are dots. You should notice the color of the corner dot is orange just to math one of the colors in the logo.

This example is similar to the  prior one but the logo was changed to Super Mario and the corner dot was changed to red for matching the color in Mario's hat.

And  the example below is similar but the shape of the code was changed to dots.

If you feel enthusiastic you can try the QR Designer and create different versions of your QR. However, you should read the next section: [Tips & Best Practices](tips) to learn some details you need to care about when you create a QR code.
